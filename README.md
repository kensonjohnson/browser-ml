# Browser Based Machine Learning

In this repository, I will be exploring the world of browser based machine learning.

## Credit where credit is due

- The Object Detection page was inspired by Jason Mayes' [Make a smart webcam in JavaScript with a TensorFlow.js pre-trained Machine Learning model](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-object-detection) codelab. I have modified his code to use TypeScript and import statements instead of script tags.
